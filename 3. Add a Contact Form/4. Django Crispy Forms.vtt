This video we're going to use Django crispy forms to make the contact form look better.

00:06.260 --> 00:09.910
This tutorial will be following the user installation guide.

00:10.090 --> 00:13.420
So go to the following Django crispy forms you are out.

00:13.870 --> 00:18.380
Go to the first installation step and copy Pipp install upgrades.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.790
Django crispy forms.

00:20.830 --> 00:24.640
Open up your terminal to install Django crispy forms.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.700
Paste this into the terminal next open.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.840
Try 10 settings IPY

00:36.300 --> 00:43.880
squirrelled to install the apps and under contact add crispy undershoot core forms.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.950
Once you're done that save settings stop.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.430
Go back to the installation guide

00:51.380 --> 01:00.040
scroll to template packs we're using the see SS frame or bootstrap 3 copy Krispy underscore template

01:00.130 --> 01:11.860
underscore pack open up setting STARKIE why and paste this at the bottom adding to it equals bootstrap

01:12.200 --> 01:12.600
3

01:17.100 --> 01:18.830
open terminal and run the server

01:25.920 --> 01:26.270
again.

01:26.290 --> 01:33.140
Open the installation guide.

01:33.360 --> 01:39.600
Scroll down to RUBINGH from Django uniform to Django crispy forms.

01:39.810 --> 01:40.420
Copy.

01:40.470 --> 01:40.970
Load.

01:40.970 --> 01:41.570
Crispy.

01:41.570 --> 01:42.700
Underscore forms.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.320
Underscore takes open contact.

01:47.390 --> 01:48.220
H-G amount.

01:53.270 --> 01:59.390
Paste what you just copied onto a line to the crispy forms tag will now be loaded.

02:01.630 --> 02:04.030
Open the installation guide again.

02:04.030 --> 02:08.560
Step 4 shows an example of applying Chris betakes by adding Krispy

02:12.060 --> 02:14.150
oping contact templates.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.120
Contact each DML and on and delete A-S underscore P-E

02:23.010 --> 02:27.080
from 110 in it's place type Krispy

02:32.900 --> 02:35.540
save and then refresh the contact page.

02:43.790 --> 02:49.280
The contact form looks way better this version of crispy form uses bootstrap 3.

02:49.340 --> 02:55.740
We can adjust the window size to see the form is now responsive.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.160
The form is too big.

02:57.510 --> 03:06.080
Let's adjust its layout go to get bootstrapped dot com slash CSSA slash pounde grid.

03:06.130 --> 03:09.260
We're going to talk about how bootstraps grid system works.

03:10.180 --> 03:17.530
First of all bootstrap works on a grid system consisting of 12 columns in each row bootstraps examples

03:17.770 --> 03:22.290
illustrate how you can divide each rows columns into different size sections.

03:22.390 --> 03:26.380
For example one row has three sections.

03:26.410 --> 03:28.930
This row is made up of three divisions.

03:28.930 --> 03:31.510
Each division has class equals.

03:31.510 --> 03:40.400
CIOL empty for the four means that each division takes up four columns of the 12 total columns available

03:40.430 --> 03:48.050
for each route because four divided by 12 equals one third each of these divisions takes up a third

03:48.050 --> 03:49.610
of the row.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.750
Bootstrap is responsive to screen size.

03:52.850 --> 04:01.390
Look at the example grid's at a specific window size the grid columns collapse into individual rows

04:07.040 --> 04:16.550
This table shows the different class prefixes available such as call them asset class prefixes change

04:16.550 --> 04:20.640
the window size the grid columns collapse and stack into rows.

04:20.750 --> 04:29.210
For example if we used column S-M for the columns at a tablet like screen size would collapse and stack

04:29.240 --> 04:33.390
into individual rows because of bootstraps responsive grid.

04:33.470 --> 04:38.950
We can create templates that work for many different screen sizes.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.310
I'm going to add a road to the project.

04:41.310 --> 04:48.840
This row will constrain the form to one section in the row four columns wide open contact on HMO and

04:48.840 --> 04:56.790
type division class equals row onto line 5 and under that on line 6 and division class equals column

04:57.150 --> 05:04.980
dash extra small dash for make sure that you add closing tags for both of your divisions.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.180
You can do this on line 17 and line 18 right under.

05:09.350 --> 05:15.180
And if make sure you save and then refresh the contact page.

05:15.230 --> 05:18.170
Now the form is a third of its previous size.

05:18.180 --> 05:24.500
Again this is because each row has 12 columns where we have constrained this form to only four columns

05:25.550 --> 05:39.510
open contact templates contact HGL and copy from division class open tag to the division closed tag.

05:39.740 --> 05:50.020
Then paste it between the two closing division tags that we established and paste that twice over save

05:50.020 --> 05:52.390
once again and refresh the contact page.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.170
There are three forms.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.360
Each form takes up a third of the row.

05:57.500 --> 06:03.170
This is because we set each division in the row to take up four columns again in Bootstrap.

06:03.170 --> 06:04.740
There are 12 columns in a row.

06:05.820 --> 06:15.160
Drag the window size smaller each column has a class of column extra small for the Prefect's exit.

06:15.180 --> 06:20.210
S means that the column in this row will never stack on top of each other.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.580
Open Contact templates.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.080
Contact him out.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.790
Replace X s with M.D

06:34.960 --> 06:37.930
save and then once again refresh your contact page.

06:39.180 --> 06:45.840
Drag the window size smaller because we change the class Prefect's to M.D the columns will now collapse

06:46.260 --> 06:47.500
on top of each other.

06:47.550 --> 06:56.850
Once the window size is less than 992 pixel the other class prefixes are listed in the same bootstrap

06:56.850 --> 07:04.850
CRID documentation I showed you earlier opened up templates contact HCM El.

07:05.080 --> 07:12.430
We're going to delete from division class equals column empty for right through the division class closing

07:12.430 --> 07:13.160
tag.

07:19.490 --> 07:30.220
Then at the end of the remaining division class and the variable which is column dash S-M dash 6 and

07:30.450 --> 07:36.340
column dash dash offset dash 3.

07:36.470 --> 07:41.130
This can be found in line 6.

07:41.140 --> 07:46.520
Now this form is six columns wide by offsetting three columns for each side of the form.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.180
We centered it in the middle of the 12 column row

07:52.830 --> 07:55.800
in this tutorial we added crispy forms to the project.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.840
We then changed the bootstrap grid system.
