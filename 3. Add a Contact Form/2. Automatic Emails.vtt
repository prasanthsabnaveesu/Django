00:01.110 --> 00:07.590
Using Gmail we want the contact form to send email go to the following doc start Shango project you

00:07.590 --> 00:09.800
are out.

00:09.850 --> 00:12.500
The quick example shows the emails format.

00:12.730 --> 00:20.230
There's a subject message through the e-mails from and the recipients fails silently means that the

00:20.230 --> 00:22.150
user will not see any errors.

00:22.180 --> 00:29.470
If the email is not sent underneath the quick example code there is a list of e-mail settings.

00:29.470 --> 00:36.910
We need an e-mail underscore host email underscore port e-mail underscore host underscore user email

00:36.910 --> 00:40.640
underscore host undershorts password in the project.

00:40.750 --> 00:47.200
We need to define these email settings we're the necessary information for users to send an email through

00:47.200 --> 00:49.400
the contact form.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.610
We'll do this under SIRC Triton settings.

00:53.860 --> 00:54.260

00:57.110 --> 01:00.930
And all of this information can be put in between lines.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.000
Eighteen lines 22

01:18.670 --> 01:32.800
five eighty seven is the port for G-mail.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.280
Now go back to jangles.

01:34.280 --> 01:39.930
Email documentation copy the quick example code.

01:40.020 --> 01:45.470
Then open contact the used IPY and directly paste it

01:53.500 --> 02:07.730
this view needs access to the email settings to import the settings type from Django comp import settings.

02:07.730 --> 02:10.040
Now let's define some email variables.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.660
Type subject equals blank

02:25.140 --> 02:27.240
below that do the same but with message

02:31.040 --> 02:37.900
again with email from.

02:37.910 --> 02:42.200
However with email too we will set the variable settings.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.990
Email underscore host underscore user

02:55.380 --> 03:00.540
because email to eco settings that email underscore host underscore user.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.990
For now the email will be sent to my inbox.

03:04.110 --> 03:07.550
Open contact forms that he y.

03:07.710 --> 03:16.700
The form has fields for name comment and email open contact used up y and cut form.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.540
Cleaned underscore data.

03:18.610 --> 03:18.910
Email

03:21.920 --> 03:28.520
this can be found on line 12 and paste it after e-mail from equals

03:31.130 --> 03:32.240
setting that variable

03:38.360 --> 03:43.310
e-mail from is sent to the email address the user puts into the contact form.

03:43.340 --> 03:51.220
We want the e-mails message to be sent to the comment and the name the user wants puts into the contact

03:51.220 --> 03:59.010
for first will clean the comment and name data then using string substitution will send the message

03:59.190 --> 04:34.710
to the forms comment to name.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.400
In this we'll want to set the variable for message

04:55.680 --> 04:57.420
for the email Subject.

04:57.690 --> 05:03.900
Set the variable by typing equals message from my site dot com

05:09.630 --> 05:20.230
but all the email variables into sendmail by typing subject message email from email to fail.

05:20.240 --> 05:38.080
Underscore silently equals true after sendmail.

05:38.110 --> 05:40.370

05:48.340 --> 05:55.330

05:55.330 --> 05:58.810

05:58.810 --> 06:04.420

06:04.420 --> 06:08.850

06:08.880 --> 06:16.010
