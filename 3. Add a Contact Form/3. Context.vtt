00:00.490 --> 00:02.920
In this tutorial we're going to work on the contact.

00:02.930 --> 00:06.040
These contacts open up contact views.

00:06.230 --> 00:21.340
Y under def contact request type title equals contac.

00:21.490 --> 00:30.610
Next you can go ahead and delete contacts contacts equals locals or make my context equal to dictionary

00:30.890 --> 00:31.860
dictionaries.

00:31.960 --> 00:39.030
Use the key value pairs a key value pair is defined as a set of two linked data items.

00:39.100 --> 00:46.120
A key which is a unique identifier for some item of data and the value which is either the data that

00:46.210 --> 00:49.600
is identified or a pointer to the location of the data

00:52.530 --> 01:01.620
under form equals contact form type context equals title title form form

01:10.670 --> 01:12.660
once that's complete save.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.090
Views y.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.440
Next open templates.

01:16.470 --> 01:24.470
Contact that HGL will want to change the header tag adding title

01:32.500 --> 01:39.820
once that's complete saved contact HMO and open up the browser refresh the contact page.

01:41.390 --> 01:46.510
From the title and the contact form is still rendered open contact.

01:46.530 --> 01:52.000
NEWS.COM why and delete form and form

01:55.590 --> 02:02.560
from the end of line 11 saved used up y and refresh the contact page.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.980
The form does not come through the submit button is still there.

02:08.990 --> 02:15.070
Go back in views that P Y and undo the delete and save.

02:15.100 --> 02:20.930
I just wanted to illustrate that for context you don't have to use locals.

02:21.010 --> 02:25.530
You can use a dictionary to specify the context to be rendered.

02:25.660 --> 02:30.860
Next open contact HVM out if the form is not rendered.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.980
The submit button should not be displayed.

02:34.060 --> 02:39.990
If for an end around the form open and closed tag

02:51.460 --> 02:53.060
open contact used up.

02:53.100 --> 03:04.550
Why and delete form and form as we did earlier save News.com P Y and refresh the contact page yet again.

03:04.590 --> 03:08.720
Now the form and the button do not come through the if statement worked.

03:08.730 --> 03:14.890
Go back into view stop and undo the delete and save when the user submits the form.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.840
We want to send the message.

03:16.980 --> 03:20.980
Will create a variable called Cf. underscore message.

03:23.980 --> 03:29.280
So under the send underscore mail line type title equals.

03:29.350 --> 03:29.860
Thanks

03:33.600 --> 03:39.900
and on the line below that I'd confirm underscore message equals.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.800
Thanks for the message.

03:41.970 --> 03:51.170
We will get right back to you.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.970
Next we're going to make another context.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.040
This context will only be rendered once the form has been validated.

03:59.580 --> 04:12.680
So type context equals title title confirm underscore message confirmed message this can be found online

04:12.680 --> 04:13.310
23

04:16.180 --> 04:23.970
open contact on HGL if the form has been validated confirmed message and the title will be rendered

04:24.270 --> 04:28.450
with the news context if confirmed message has been rendered.

04:28.520 --> 04:36.090
We want confirmed underscore a message to be displayed and if confirmed underscore message and if

05:11.870 --> 05:17.730
safe contact HMO go ahead and refresh Krome.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.620
Now you can fill out the contact form

05:22.950 --> 05:26.480
once that's complete submit the form

05:30.760 --> 05:32.320
once the form is validated.

05:32.470 --> 05:37.600
The context changes confirm message and the new title is displayed.

05:38.900 --> 05:45.530
Refresh the contact page.

05:45.730 --> 05:47.690
The contact form is displayed again.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.150
Open Contact.

05:49.270 --> 05:49.830
NEWS.COM.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.530
He y.

05:52.100 --> 05:56.150
We want to move this context out of the if statement.

05:56.500 --> 06:02.510
Cut context equals title and pasted below an ad for

06:15.120 --> 06:24.280
next we can go and delete context equals title title form form from line 11.

06:24.290 --> 06:27.580
Now we want to go and type confirm underscore message.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.090
Equals none.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.280
In it's place.

06:34.790 --> 06:43.750
Following that we will add form equals none into line 23 before the form is submitted.

06:43.750 --> 06:44.240
Confirm.

06:44.260 --> 06:45.910
Underscore message equals none.

06:46.180 --> 06:54.610
When the form is posted and the data is valid form equals none the context renders title form and confirm

06:54.610 --> 06:56.010
underscore message.

06:56.020 --> 07:01.050
The template will then display whatever context is rendered saved News.com News.com.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.850
Refresh the home page and you can go fill out the contact form.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.110
Submit the form and then refresh contact

07:18.730 --> 07:19.440
contact.

07:19.480 --> 07:26.790
HMO displays the appropriate context on contact open profiles used IPY

07:31.520 --> 07:36.160
and on your contex line delete equals local's equally.

07:36.410 --> 07:44.740
Remove this below on line 10 and locals place will put an empty dictionary

07:47.810 --> 07:50.940
local's puts everything in each view is the context.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.440
This lack of specificity is a major drawback to using locals.

07:55.460 --> 08:03.510
That's why in this video I showed you how to hard code the views contex save profiles used up y and

08:03.520 --> 08:04.240
refresh Krumm

08:09.630 --> 08:16.570
because the home and about page don't have any context to display the empty dictionary does not affect

08:16.570 --> 08:16.960
them.
