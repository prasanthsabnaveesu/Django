WEBVTT

00:02.450 --> 00:08.000
What we ultimately want out of this project is the ability to sell product whatever that may be to do

00:08.000 --> 00:08.460
so.

00:08.510 --> 00:11.180
We're going to use Strype to accept payments.

00:11.180 --> 00:21.560
First we need to install Strype in terminal closed the server type Pipp install streite then type pit

00:21.650 --> 00:22.190
freeze

00:24.930 --> 00:26.360
Strype is now installed.

00:27.350 --> 00:32.160
Next we need to create a new app so type python managed.

00:32.180 --> 00:37.620
P Why start at Cecco and go to striped or com.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.780
First you're going to have to create an account.

00:39.850 --> 00:46.210
Once you've done that go to your main stripe dashboard from here will be able to manage our Strype account

00:46.300 --> 00:47.950
and user payments.

00:47.950 --> 00:51.390
Next open Try 10 setting Stucky why

00:56.070 --> 01:05.400
add Strype and check to installed apps save settings IPY open up check out views W-why will create a

01:05.400 --> 01:16.010
new view which will render our checkout form so open profiles used why copy log in required rate through

01:16.010 --> 01:19.710
return render next you're going to paste everything.

01:19.820 --> 01:27.020
Open profiles UDP white and copy line 1 then return to check view stop he y and pasted on line 1.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.120
Type check out after death.

01:33.090 --> 01:36.050
Then delete and check out.

01:36.220 --> 01:37.920
HTL.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.500
If the user is not logged in they will be redirected to the logon page.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.870
We need to create the template.

01:43.880 --> 01:48.490
Check out the HD MLM S.R. see Cecco.

01:48.490 --> 01:51.980
Create a new folder called templates.

01:52.200 --> 01:57.110
Then make a new file save it and check out templates as Cecco that HDMI out.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.110
Open templates profiles that aged him out.

02:01.310 --> 02:03.730
Copy all of profiles that H-G amount.

02:04.010 --> 02:12.390
Then open Cecco can aged him out paste and delete usery username user email on line 5 and 6 save.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.820
Check out our HD amount.

02:14.930 --> 02:19.890
We now need to make sure you are out for the Cecco page so open try 10 years or else stop.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.570
Why.

02:21.660 --> 02:29.190
First let's import the checkout view type into line 23 from check out import views as.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.280
Check out underscore views

02:41.620 --> 02:42.940
on line 29.

02:42.940 --> 03:07.040
Copy the profile you are out and then paste and add the necessary Cecco parameters.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.710
Once you've done that save you you are stuck.

03:09.720 --> 03:14.160
Why open up your terminal and collect your static files.

03:15.030 --> 03:22.140
Once you've done that you can open up Crome make sure that you are logged and once you are go to slash

03:22.140 --> 03:29.950
check it log in is required for this page to render will be redirected to the logon page so you can

03:29.950 --> 03:34.140
go ahead and log in now were redirected to slash.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.530
Check out the Cecco page is blank.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.480
Go to the following Strype you are el.

03:41.640 --> 03:46.800
Once you're there copy the form from the example code.

03:46.880 --> 03:53.350
Once you have that copied open check out DML and then paste the borrowed code in your content block

03:53.490 --> 03:54.790
on check out Chimo

04:01.330 --> 04:03.860
once that's complete go back to Strype dot com.

04:04.810 --> 04:12.490
Scroll down to step 1 collecting credit card information and then copy script type open profiles templates

04:12.490 --> 04:21.530
based on age TNL and then paste all of the copied code right below placed at the end of the document

04:21.530 --> 04:26.540
so the pages load faster then add a new script block with a properly marked and

04:45.160 --> 04:48.980
open check out that H.T. amount.

04:49.210 --> 04:53.650
Similarly add a new script block under extends based on amount

04:58.420 --> 05:02.360
go back to the Strype you are up still from step 1.

05:02.460 --> 05:08.920
Copy script type equals text slash javascript.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.970
Then open Cecco HMO and paste it in your new block

05:17.030 --> 05:19.330
once that's complete you can save Cecco daddy.

05:20.360 --> 05:25.640
If you're viewing Strypes documentation while Lyddon stripe changes the example code to include your

05:25.640 --> 05:27.220
API keys.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.190
This is our actual publishable key.

05:30.290 --> 05:34.990
Go to the dashboard click your account then account settings.

05:35.420 --> 05:42.130
You may be prompted to sign and click on the API keys tab to reset the API key.

05:42.230 --> 05:51.080
Click the arrows icon go back to your provided you are out and make sure that you're signed in refresh.

05:51.130 --> 05:55.290
Slash check it.

05:55.370 --> 06:05.770
We now have a credit card form open check out H.T. amount type and add C-s Areff underscore token CSIR

06:05.790 --> 06:08.420
F stands for cross site reference forgery.

06:08.580 --> 06:11.990
It prevents the other sites from submitting our site's forms.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.910
This is effectively here for the sake of security.

06:14.910 --> 06:21.650
Next we want to add some bootstrap classes to this form while centering the form inside of a row within

06:21.650 --> 06:27.400
the content block we'll be introducing divisions by adding classes to our specified division.

06:27.410 --> 06:52.400
We're maintaining that bootstrap CSSA will be properly applied.

06:52.430 --> 06:57.260
Once you've done that you can save Cecco out each DML and then refresh slash checkout.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.140
The form was looking a lot better.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.260
Hit submit payment.

07:00.260 --> 07:01.670
Nothing happens.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.250
Go back to the stripe euro.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.070
Next we're going to scroll to step 2.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.010
We need to create a single use token.

07:09.380 --> 07:15.220
Open Cecco got HDMI out at a jig Querrey block

07:21.850 --> 07:26.920
and make sure to add an end block and then paste the J-curve function in between the two

07:33.700 --> 07:34.450
once that's complete.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.790
You can save Cecco to add HDMI out.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.530
We need to load this block of a query into the base file.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.150
So open templates based but each DML

07:48.020 --> 07:49.120
and then type scripts

07:53.310 --> 07:57.860
below your last block below that add document ready.

07:57.960 --> 08:24.720
Function.

08:24.730 --> 08:38.460
This we're going to add another J query block.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.530
Don't worry too much about this J query.

08:40.650 --> 08:47.070
Just know that this is loading the J query which straight needs to work done that we can go back to

08:47.070 --> 08:49.470
stripe dot com.

08:49.470 --> 08:51.560
We need to send the form to our server.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.260
So scroll to step 3

08:56.910 --> 09:01.080
then copy the block of code provide open templates.

09:01.090 --> 09:10.720
Check him out and we're going to copy that code in just above the script tag that can be found online.

09:12.320 --> 09:18.300
Once that's complete save and refresh slash checkout on your you URL hits a submit payment again.

09:18.440 --> 09:24.620
This time we get a prompt that says could not find payment information Strypes test card number is 4

09:24.620 --> 09:27.580
to 4 to 4 times over.

09:27.680 --> 09:36.530
Then put in any three digit CVC number make up any future end date and hit submit payment.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.890
Nothing happens before Strype will take my payment.

09:39.910 --> 09:43.580
We need to set up a few more things in the next tutorial.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.220
We will continue to set up strict.
