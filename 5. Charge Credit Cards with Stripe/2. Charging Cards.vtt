WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:03.760
Open up Crome and go to your slash check you're out.

00:03.780 --> 00:08.700
We're in the process of setting up straight to take credit card payments in the last tutorial when we

00:08.700 --> 00:11.670
feel that this form with the test card nothing happened.

00:11.910 --> 00:17.620
So go to your striped dashboard no money actually came through.

00:17.650 --> 00:23.770
We need to change the check a view to handle straight open checkout used up he y.

00:23.870 --> 00:26.250
We want to see what the forum is posting.

00:26.450 --> 00:35.150
So tight if requests method equal equal post colon and below that print request.

00:35.240 --> 00:35.720
Post

00:40.360 --> 00:42.260
once that's complete say News.com.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.000
He y.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.670
And refresh.

00:44.690 --> 00:45.660
Slash check it.

00:49.770 --> 00:56.690
Fill out the form again with the test card provided which is 4 to 4 to 4 times over and then submit

00:56.690 --> 00:57.110
payment

01:00.180 --> 01:01.200
opened up your terminal

01:03.810 --> 01:11.630
host is printed striped token and see SRF middleware token are posted.

01:11.720 --> 01:16.530
The straight token is used to securely send credit card information to Strypes servers where it's then

01:16.530 --> 01:21.280
charged we need to check a view to store the posted value of striped token.

01:21.570 --> 01:25.770
So open checkout views top Y and delete print request.

01:25.800 --> 01:34.970
Post will create a local variable we'll call this local variable token token or store the posted value

01:34.970 --> 01:36.060
of Strype token.

01:36.310 --> 01:49.180
So type token equals request that posts straight token and below that print token.

01:49.250 --> 01:54.930
Once you're done with that save views thought y and refresh flash check it.

01:55.090 --> 02:00.010
Once again you're going to want to fill out the form entering Strypes test card and submitting the payment

02:02.630 --> 02:04.520
open up your terminal.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.520
The value of token is printed.

02:07.700 --> 02:14.640
We need to add our stripe API key to setting up why so open try 10 settings stop.

02:14.730 --> 02:18.970
Why scroll right to the bottom and take the following code.

02:26.300 --> 02:40.580
Pounde Strypes stuff into 185 pound testee into 187 in 188 Strype underscore publishable underscore

02:40.760 --> 02:41.150
key

02:51.050 --> 02:55.360
under that you're going to add Strype equals secret underscore key equals

03:03.550 --> 03:07.930
skipping down to line 1 91 lb. life.

03:08.010 --> 03:08.800
Keys.

03:09.390 --> 03:15.730
Low that pound Strype underscore publishable underscore key equals

03:18.390 --> 03:23.780
and pound Strype underscore secret underscore equals which can be copied from the code above.

03:23.910 --> 03:27.770
Next go to Strype dot com and go to your dashboard.

03:27.810 --> 03:32.220
I want to point out that on the left side there is a switch for test and wife.

03:32.220 --> 03:35.190
For now we're just going to keep it on test.

03:35.430 --> 03:42.350
Click on your account then account settings and click on the API key tabs.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.940
Here are my two sets of API keys.

03:45.090 --> 03:48.210
One set for testing the other set for life.

03:48.210 --> 03:53.800
Remember if you want to you can refresh your API keys by clicking the arrows next to them.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.550
Copy each key and paste it into its corresponding variable in setting up Hiwatt

04:06.210 --> 04:08.950
will need to reference the straight keys often.

04:09.110 --> 04:14.630
If we ever have to update or straight piece will only have to paste the new keys into one spot in setting

04:14.640 --> 04:15.560
subcu wide.

04:15.740 --> 04:24.770
When you go live uncomment the life keys comment out the test keys open check out news top White before

04:24.770 --> 04:26.660
we can reference our striped keys.

04:26.660 --> 04:35.280
We need to import settings into line 1 tape from Django that Dotcom's import settings

04:41.660 --> 04:52.980
and belowdecks check requests can be found on line 7 ad published key equals settings that stripe underscore

04:53.580 --> 05:02.100
publishable underscore key.

05:02.310 --> 05:08.340
Lastly update your context variable adding publish key Colan publish keep

05:18.050 --> 05:19.620
Now that that's complete open.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.840
Check out templates.

05:20.840 --> 05:27.710
Check out that H.T. amount and replace the hardcoded key with the published key variable which is rendered

05:27.710 --> 05:34.500
through context type published key to the end of line 6

05:38.830 --> 05:43.220
open views t why we need to create another local variable.

05:43.330 --> 05:52.230
We'll call this variable secret key secret key will store our straight secret key type secret key settings

05:52.500 --> 05:59.550
that Strype underscore secret underscore key with that complete.

05:59.550 --> 06:07.410
Open up a browser window and go back to Strypes documentation from the left panel click creating charges.

06:07.410 --> 06:14.290
This page explains how to charge a customer next make sure the python tab is selected for the code example

06:15.610 --> 06:19.100
and copy striped API underscore.

06:19.090 --> 06:25.210
Keep next open checking views Tarpey why paste the copied code.

06:26.290 --> 06:31.230
Make sure that you add into line for import Strype.

06:31.250 --> 06:39.290
Next we're going to want to delete a few hard line quotes so delete secret key equals replacing it with

06:39.290 --> 06:47.350
settings dot stripe underscore secret underscore key all we've done is set straight that API underscore

06:47.350 --> 06:52.460
key equal settings but Strype underscore secret underscore key.

06:52.480 --> 07:00.000
Go back to Strypes documentation the example code sets the Strype token to a variable called token then

07:00.000 --> 07:02.020
tries to charge the customer.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.910
We already have tokin but we need the code that tries to charge the actual customer.

07:08.010 --> 07:20.060
So copy the cell code open check out NeuStar p y delete print token from line 14 and paste the copied

07:20.060 --> 07:20.900
code here.

07:22.390 --> 07:26.980
For this to work the Python code should be tabbed in as follows.

07:27.980 --> 07:34.100
Once the payment form is submitted this view will try to charge the customer if the card cannot be charged

07:34.310 --> 07:35.860
an error message will show.

07:36.110 --> 07:38.550
Save used up white.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.520
I'm going to sum up how charging a customer or stripe works.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.210
Then we'll test it out.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.870
Published he is set to my publishable underscore key

07:50.370 --> 07:57.270
Strype underscore API underscore key is set to my secret key.

07:57.330 --> 08:04.470
I set these keys in setting Sabahi why I then imported my settings into this view the publishable key

08:04.680 --> 08:08.700
and secret key is required by Strype to charge a customer.

08:08.700 --> 08:12.360
I put my publisher key into context.

08:12.420 --> 08:18.810
Context is rendered with the template out aged him out when the checkout form is submitted.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.530
The data is posted.

08:20.730 --> 08:25.280
The value of the posted Strype token is saved in a variable called token.

08:25.550 --> 08:32.450
The check of view then tries to charge a customer if the card cannot be charged and airwork will show.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.540
So let's try it out.

08:34.590 --> 08:35.970
Reflect refresh.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.530
Slash checkout.

08:37.700 --> 09:00.640
Fill out the form and submit it.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.520
There's money in my Strype account.

09:02.840 --> 09:10.150
You could charge different amounts but change in with them not equal to in the checkout view.

09:10.240 --> 09:16.270
If I change the settings to use the live keys then flip the stripe dashboard switch to life.

09:16.450 --> 09:18.340
I could start charging for real money

09:22.620 --> 09:23.870
just a little side note.

09:24.030 --> 09:31.140
If you receive an error that says authentication error Strype no longer supports API requests made with

09:31.140 --> 09:32.160
tell us one point.

09:32.160 --> 09:36.730
Oh please initiate connections with tail less 1.2 or later.

09:36.900 --> 09:41.060
It's because you were using an older version of Python or open SSL.

09:41.100 --> 09:48.450
That's why you'd get this error message so go to your L and follow the upgrade instructions for your

09:48.450 --> 09:49.250
system.

09:49.290 --> 09:50.840
Shrike will then work on your server.
