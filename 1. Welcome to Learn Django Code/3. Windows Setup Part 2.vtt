WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:06.470
Jingoes done downloading and Stalag but I'm just going to and Schertz installed correctly.

00:06.730 --> 00:16.600
Go back tiered Django tutorial page and copy Python C import and go print and go dog version paste that

00:16.600 --> 00:17.980
into your bash console.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.300
Press enter.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.580
I see one point 7.2.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.860
Therefore no change.

00:23.880 --> 00:29.260
Version 1 point 7.2 has been successfully installed into my virtual environment.

00:30.850 --> 00:38.420
I'm going to create a new Gengel project type Django dash Armento IPY start project and I'll be calling

00:38.420 --> 00:40.280
this project try and go.

00:40.460 --> 00:42.360
But you could call it whatever you like.

00:42.500 --> 00:48.100
Press enter and not just go projects being created.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.120
Open a new tab with your dashboard for this time go to files.

00:54.220 --> 01:01.630
And I could see my new Gengel project called Try Django and then there's another folder called Try Django

01:03.000 --> 01:04.890
and there's a setting stop why file in it.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.780
So click on that.

01:07.790 --> 01:11.620
The great thing about Python anywhere is that it has a built in text editor.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.990
This means you can build entire site from Python anywhere.

01:15.850 --> 01:19.630
In my studies IPY file is a few things I could change.

01:19.630 --> 01:26.770
One of them is my database escalatory but the Django tutorial recommends you use escalatory.

01:27.010 --> 01:29.430
So I'll just leave it as is for now.

01:29.480 --> 01:34.480
The other thing you can change is your time zone but I'll just leave it as is.

01:34.480 --> 01:40.060
Anytime you make changes in Python anywhere make sure you save because otherwise your changes won't

01:40.060 --> 01:40.830
come through.

01:43.530 --> 01:49.410
So if I go back to the Django tutorial I'm going to explain to you the major difference between developing

01:49.410 --> 01:53.460
on line with Python anywhere and developing on my local machine.

01:54.890 --> 01:59.790
So the major difference is don't try and run Python managed all.

01:59.810 --> 02:03.670
Why run server in future videos.

02:03.670 --> 02:05.040
I'll be running this command.

02:05.050 --> 02:11.770
Python managed shoppy Why run server but you won't have to do this with Python anywhere because your

02:11.770 --> 02:17.400
sites already live and pite on any servers aren't set up to use that command.

02:17.830 --> 02:21.650
Instead of show you what you'll do.

02:21.780 --> 02:29.730
So if you go back to the tutorial I need to create a new webapp.

02:30.230 --> 02:42.070
So I'll open a new dashboard and go to a web and I could delete this one so I'll click.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.310
I added new webapp.

02:43.310 --> 02:46.080
The one I just deleted I'd made before.

02:46.190 --> 02:51.180
Click on new webapp and click next.

02:51.310 --> 02:56.890
Then go to manual configuration and I'll be using Python 2.7.

02:56.890 --> 02:58.200
So when I click Next again

03:02.630 --> 03:03.590
there we go.

03:03.620 --> 03:06.360
Now I'm taken to the web configuration page

03:09.940 --> 03:19.600
so the next thing I need to do is configure this webpage I need to make my virtual environment path

03:20.170 --> 03:25.650
go back to the Jane go to Tauriel and copy their example path

03:29.660 --> 03:33.950
go back to the webapp configuration page and paste in that path.

03:33.990 --> 03:40.720
But instead of my username I'll paste in my real username which is Archie and then ahu that checkmark.

03:40.730 --> 03:41.000
OK.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.280
So that virtual vibrant path.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.580
That's good.

03:43.580 --> 03:50.310
The last thing I need to do before this Django project is up and running is configure my WSG file.

03:50.510 --> 03:54.390
So click on your file and will be using Django.

03:54.460 --> 04:00.040
So that's the only one I really need so I could delete everything from 9:52 flask all the way down the

04:00.250 --> 04:07.370
line 115 and then I could also delete everything on top and go just to clean it up a little bit.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.630
And then I'll start on coalmining what I need.

04:11.670 --> 04:17.310
So in Calment in port OS in port s y s o uncomment this path

04:20.610 --> 04:27.970
everything with the one hash is where any in a comment and then I'll be using Django 1.7.

04:28.140 --> 04:37.180
So of uncomment that one here and now on.

04:37.330 --> 04:47.090
And the last oh you click save but the last thing I need to do is change my path because as you see

04:47.090 --> 04:52.090
here they're assuming it's going to home nurturing my site saying Stop white.

04:52.400 --> 04:57.930
But as I showed you before it's actually going to home nurture.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.710
Try Django try Django sending stuff he y.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.940
So I'll change that.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.300
And where did you change that.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.200
It's here.

05:09.250 --> 05:17.690
So try Shingo Stosh try and go

05:20.790 --> 05:23.200
and then connected the settings file.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.150
Oh we all need one.

05:26.960 --> 05:35.460
Because the other one goes down here charging go toward settings so have it set up just like this.

05:35.710 --> 05:39.690
Click save.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.150
And once it saves it should be ready to go.

05:43.530 --> 05:44.710
Just make sure there's no problems.

05:44.730 --> 05:45.100
OK.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.150
Looking good.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.230
Hardly any problems if there were.

05:49.280 --> 05:58.290
So if I go back to my dashboard back to the Web tab and this is a very important thing whenever you

05:58.290 --> 06:03.790
make a change on pite on anywhere wherever you change a file save a new file and you want to see the

06:03.790 --> 06:04.920
changes come through.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.850
You have to reload your site.

06:07.230 --> 06:10.020
So click this big green button and let it reload.

06:12.260 --> 06:18.650
And then once it's done I can follow this link and I'll see that my Gengel project is up and running.

06:18.650 --> 06:19.390
There you go.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.470
It worked.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.630
Congratulations on your first Django card page.

06:23.810 --> 06:28.750
Now that you have jingoes set up and working on Python anywhere you're ready to follow me step by step

06:29.000 --> 06:32.220
as I build and launch a site that accepts payments with.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.340
Thank you for joining me in the next one.

06:35.420 --> 06:40.810
One quick thing to note if you're going to be using a free Python anywhere account to take this course.

06:41.090 --> 06:46.730
Everything in this course will work perfectly on a free Python anywhere account except using striped

06:47.660 --> 06:53.990
Python anywhere has a policy where Strype API calls will not go through unless you pay for at least

06:53.990 --> 06:56.100
a $5 amount plan.

06:56.150 --> 07:01.610
I guess their belief is that if you're going to be making money they want a little bit of money as well.

07:01.610 --> 07:07.590
I really apologize that the strike portion won't work on the free account but everything else will work.

07:07.700 --> 07:12.690
And if you fall along with me you'll have all the skills you need to accept payments with.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.600
When the time being comes that you need to.
