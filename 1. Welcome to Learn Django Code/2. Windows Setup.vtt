WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:05.870
The easiest way for Windows users to take this course they just signed up for free Python anywhere count.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.220
I'm not connected to Python anywhere.

00:08.220 --> 00:12.640
It's just an easy way to build your Django app and get it online.

00:12.690 --> 00:14.400
So I'll take you through the set process.

00:14.430 --> 00:20.040
Go to pipe going anywhere don't call and create a free account then sign in and click on the Help tab

00:20.260 --> 00:23.560
and the nav bar click on step by step guide.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.940
I'll be taking you through the jungle.

00:24.970 --> 00:30.480
Tauriel when we are done setting up Gengel and peptone anywhere you'll be all set to take the course

00:30.910 --> 00:37.740
to go to this euro and the first thing I need to do is create a new bash console open a new top to your

00:37.740 --> 00:41.100
pipe or anywhere dashboard and you're starting new council.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.030
Click on Flash

00:46.490 --> 00:52.980
go back to the Django tutorial.

00:53.090 --> 00:55.400
I need to create a new virtual environment.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.830
Remember that virtual environments ensure that none of the protip dependencies conflict to create a

01:00.830 --> 01:02.200
new virtual environment.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.670
Copy and virtual NVI Django 17 all the way to Python.

01:08.350 --> 01:11.030
Go to your bash console and paste it.

01:11.260 --> 01:17.220
However I'm a Python 2.7 to type 2.7 at the end and press ENTER

01:21.810 --> 01:27.170
So pipe anywhere named this virtual environment jingoes 17 just to stick to the pipelining were changed

01:27.180 --> 01:31.780
Torro as much as possible or keep the virtual environment name Ichigo 17.

01:31.800 --> 01:37.650
I know the virtual varment is active because the virtual varment name Jager's 17 is now in brackets.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.030
Now the virtual varments active.

01:39.030 --> 01:45.350
Anything I install will be self-contained or use the Python packages or Pipp to install Django abusing

01:45.460 --> 01:54.130
Gengel version of awkward tend to take Pip and JEGGO equals equals 1.10 and to ensure Django has been

01:54.130 --> 01:54.910
installed.

01:54.910 --> 01:55.800
Go back to Tauriel.

01:55.810 --> 02:02.390
Copy this line open your bash console 1.10 print it.

02:02.390 --> 02:08.720
Therefore know Django has been successfully installed to create a new Django project and the bash console

02:08.780 --> 02:13.270
run Jadot dash oddment Doppie Why start a project.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.810
Try JEGGO.

02:14.810 --> 02:16.720
I called this project chargÃ© ago.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.740
You can call it whatever you like.

02:18.740 --> 02:22.090
Open another browser top to the Python and the word dashboard.

02:22.290 --> 02:23.880
A click on files.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.720
Go in and try and go try Django.

02:27.050 --> 02:32.730
And this is the path to setting stoppie Why so click on settings to occupy to open it.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.300
IPhone anywhere has a built in text editor.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.780
This means you could build the entire site from Python anywhere.

02:39.810 --> 02:41.600
Scroll down 178.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.330
This is where the database is set.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.040
Oliv. Eskew light as the default database.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.620
Just remember that whenever you make a change to a file using the pipeline it anywhere editor.

02:50.730 --> 02:53.370
Make sure to click the save it go back to the directory.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.130
Tauriel.

02:54.270 --> 03:00.090
One major difference between developing on line pipe on anywhere and developing a local machine is if

03:00.090 --> 03:04.980
you are using pipeline anywhere you don't have to run the local server or show you what to do instead

03:05.750 --> 03:06.490
of the pie going anywhere.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.450
Dashboard click on Web click on any web tab

03:14.190 --> 03:18.010
that hit next hit Matto configuration pipelined 2.7.

03:18.170 --> 03:19.660
Hit next one more time.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.660
And this is the web configuration page.

03:22.660 --> 03:28.910
Scroll down to the virtual in the section of the path to your virtual in the upby something like home.

03:28.930 --> 03:33.800
Your username dot virtual in the slash your virtual name.

03:33.940 --> 03:43.560
So my path is slash slash energy Sastre bought virtual ien vs slash jingoes 17 I drew the section code

03:44.430 --> 03:51.760
click on the W SGI configuration file delete all the unnecessary stuff delete from line 1 to Django

03:53.260 --> 03:55.690
then delete from the old chain go to the Barner

04:02.360 --> 04:03.690
and comment section.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.600
Of course portaging.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.710
Go 1.10.

04:07.490 --> 04:11.250
Then update the path from my site to name you called your Django.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.620
I called mine.

04:12.630 --> 04:13.670
Try Django.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.370
So Line 8 home nor trace.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.240
Try Django that on line 12.

04:19.470 --> 04:23.080
Tried Django got settings and hit save.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.690
Go back to the Web tab.

04:24.750 --> 04:28.480
Make sure to reload your web page then click on her website link.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.650
I can see that jingoes now all set up open the bash Colazal to clear the screen run clear and is set

04:34.660 --> 04:37.550
up my database listing all the files in this directory.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.260
Run LS when needed change into the root of the project.

04:41.310 --> 04:46.640
The root of the project is where the file manager will be wise to change directories run a CD.

04:46.650 --> 04:50.340
Try Django directories the same thing as a folder.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.210
Run LS I see manage.

04:52.230 --> 04:56.800
Why therefore a gnome in the root of the project to migrate the database run.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.030
I don't imagine you why migrate.

04:59.160 --> 05:06.820
I'm going to create a new superuser run pipe or manage IPY creates super user a user's username and

05:06.820 --> 05:12.730
password to log into Gengel Abbot.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.570
So go back to the Web tab and hit the reload button

05:18.790 --> 05:20.870
and then click on your website address.

05:20.950 --> 05:27.940
Go to slash oddment bargain with your superuser credentials explain more about J go Adam and later.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.790
I want to finish setting it up first.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.490
This is all coming true because I haven't set up the stock photos yet before I set up the site files.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.280
I need to create a few folders in Python anywhere.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.430
Open the files tab

05:42.230 --> 05:47.430
and go to Home slash your username create a new directory.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.860
Call it static

05:51.820 --> 05:58.640
in the stack directory create three new folders the first called static could get you to go back to

05:58.840 --> 06:04.130
that current directory called a second static only and the third media

06:08.550 --> 06:13.700
then go with the whole notchy static static and create three new directories.

06:13.790 --> 06:23.410
The first I agree succored see a US finally create a job a script folder

06:26.580 --> 06:32.590
that go back to the Web tap and scroll down to static files before the stock falls will come through.

06:32.590 --> 06:38.440
And you just set up static files entry point the euro the static Eurail to the folder specified as a

06:38.440 --> 06:48.200
static route set the euro and directory to home slash your username in my case not actually SAS started

06:48.310 --> 06:49.520
SAS static only

06:56.920 --> 07:00.140
then open title anywhere setting stock Kiwa

07:06.750 --> 07:08.050
and scroll to the bottom.

07:14.230 --> 07:19.940
I'm going to put some directory paths or when debug equals true debug will only equal true trigged element

07:20.560 --> 07:24.130
so that users don't see errors only to change this when the site is live.

07:27.310 --> 07:28.850
Just make sure it's equal true.

07:28.900 --> 07:34.600
And then on the bottom say stop here y type if debug static route equals this path.

07:34.600 --> 07:43.640
Static files equals this path to no static great and static files directories all set up the project

07:43.760 --> 07:46.900
CSSA javascript will go into the site directory.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
It's just important that the settings are here.

07:48.990 --> 07:54.460
So the abstract files will serve properly opened your basket also from the root of the project run.

07:54.570 --> 07:59.020
Python managed IPY collects Dodik who Bactrim more than any other web tab.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.310
Reload the page go to slash Arbet

08:08.940 --> 08:09.490
great.

08:09.510 --> 08:10.870
The balls are coming through.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.330
Now you can follow along in future videos and everything will work with Python anywhere.

08:15.330 --> 08:20.430
The main thing to remember is that future videos when I run my local development server on Python anywhere

08:20.580 --> 08:21.540
you don't have to.

08:21.680 --> 08:28.380
Instead whenever you make a change for Python anywhere project make sure to reload the webapp then you

08:28.390 --> 08:30.540
see your project lies.

08:30.550 --> 08:34.920
Now you have J-Lo's set up and working on Python anywhere you are ready to follow step by step.

08:34.930 --> 08:41.030
As I build and launch a site that accepts payment was streite of building my app on OSX.

08:41.170 --> 08:45.270
But the code and file structure be exactly the same for pipelined anywhere.
