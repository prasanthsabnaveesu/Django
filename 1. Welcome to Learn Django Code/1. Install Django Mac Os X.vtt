This tutorial series I'm going to teach you how to use Django to build an e-commerce Web site.

00:04.860 --> 00:06.630
I hope you'll be able to use this to make money.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.420
Go to w w w.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.430
Gengel project dot com.

00:11.580 --> 00:14.740
This class will introduce you to Gengel version 1 10.

00:14.970 --> 00:18.540
Django is a framework that is written in the Python programming language.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.460
Remember programming is about rolling with the punches.

00:21.700 --> 00:25.540
If you get an error Google it the first couple of links will normally solve the problem.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.720
Let's get started with Jane and go 1.10.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.150
Open your terminal to list out folders in your current directory.

00:32.150 --> 00:36.580
Type LS to change into the desktop directory type.

00:36.620 --> 00:43.410
See the desktop CD stands for change directory allowing the user to navigate the desktop.

00:43.870 --> 00:48.830
We want to install a virtual environment or virtual environment allows us to keep our project dependencies

00:48.830 --> 00:49.660
separate.

00:49.820 --> 00:56.090
Before we can install a virtual environment we first have to install Pipp as a tool for installing and

00:56.090 --> 01:04.770
managing Python packages to install Pipp type pseudo easy underscore install Peppe.

01:04.990 --> 01:10.550
When you use the sudo command you may need to type in your administrator password.

01:10.580 --> 01:20.000
We can now use pepped to install our virtual environment type pseudo hip install Virtual E and B to

01:20.000 --> 01:24.800
create a new virtual environment run virtual NVI.

01:25.010 --> 01:26.540
Try 10.

01:26.570 --> 01:27.850
I've named this virtual environment.

01:27.850 --> 01:28.620
Try 10.

01:28.670 --> 01:36.530
Although you can name your virtual environment anything you want my virtual environment has been created.

01:36.610 --> 01:37.950
I can now see it on my desktop

01:41.910 --> 01:47.380
so go back to your terminal change into the try 10 directory by typing CD.

01:47.420 --> 01:59.160
Try 10 to activate the virtual environment on OSX type source in slash activate on Windows to activate

01:59.160 --> 02:08.680
the virtual environment type period backslash scripts backslash activate.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.810
I know my virtual environment is running because I can see the directory name in brackets whenever you

02:13.810 --> 02:14.980
work on this project.

02:14.980 --> 02:21.380
Make sure your virtual environment is active running the command pit freeze.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.060
Well allow me to see what packages are installed on my virtual environment.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.610
So type hit freeze.

02:27.670 --> 02:33.600
We currently don't have any project dependencies and so to list all the folders and files in this directory

02:34.000 --> 02:38.050
type LS inside of the try tender rectory.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.040
I have three folders in include and lib.

02:42.380 --> 02:52.400
I also have one file Hippe self-check Jason go to your desktop and click on the try tenfold.

02:52.410 --> 02:55.590
These are the same files that I just listed open or terminal.

02:55.590 --> 03:00.290
So that's how we use Terminal to navigate through our directories.

03:00.300 --> 03:11.710
So now I'm going to install Django run Peppe install Django equal equal 1.10 Django is now downloading

03:11.710 --> 03:14.580
and installing.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.230
You can use any text editor you like.

03:17.230 --> 03:26.480
However for this project I will be using subline text opened up your browser and go to w w w dot Sublime

03:26.480 --> 03:32.930
Text dot com I'll be downloading the free OSX version of the subline text

03:36.470 --> 03:41.300
in your terminal type freeze Django version.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.250
1.10 was installed.

03:43.670 --> 03:48.620
You can use another version of Django but you may need to read that version's documentation to see any

03:48.620 --> 03:49.580
differences.

03:50.910 --> 03:57.350
Django 2 should be coming out around December 2017 when Django too is launched a fully update this course.

03:57.420 --> 04:03.400
I'm going to create a new Django project type Django slash admen.

04:03.450 --> 04:06.130
Q Why start project.

04:06.220 --> 04:11.660
Triton again I call this project Triton.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.490
You can name it whatever you want.

04:13.520 --> 04:20.910
I'm going to navigate into the tried 10 directory type LS.

04:21.070 --> 04:27.490
You can see the new Django project called Triton cinammon navigate into the Django project type city

04:27.750 --> 04:34.360
Triton to list all of the folders and files and try type ls.

04:34.590 --> 04:41.530
The word of the project is the directory that contains managed IPY in the try 10 directory I see manage

04:41.560 --> 04:42.420
P Y.

04:42.450 --> 04:51.510
Therefore I know I'm in the root of the project in Django 1.10 to sync the database type python managed

04:51.520 --> 04:51.830
died.

04:51.860 --> 04:57.220
P Why migrate all discuss migration more in detail later.

04:58.150 --> 05:02.470
The first time you run migrate a prompt will appear asking if a super user should be created.

05:02.530 --> 05:12.460
Type YES TAKE ANY user name email and a password twice you are prompted to create a Gengel superuser

05:12.790 --> 05:17.390
type python manage D-y create super use.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.930
Then select your details from your desktop.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.420
Open the virtual environment.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.720
Try 10 folder with finder.

05:25.910 --> 05:29.180
Click on the Django application folder tried 10.

05:29.210 --> 05:39.340
Now the database is sinked a file called D-B Eskew like 3 is automatically created in the project open

05:39.390 --> 05:47.720
terminal and navigate to the root of the project to run the local development server type python managed

05:47.720 --> 05:58.490
IPY run server open up your web browser and go to the IP address shown in the terminal.

05:58.500 --> 06:04.560
I can now see the Gengel project is working Gengel admin gives site administrators an easy way to manage

06:04.560 --> 06:08.140
the project's data to get to Django admin.

06:08.280 --> 06:16.970
Just add the slash admin to the end of the URL then type in your super user username and password.

06:16.970 --> 06:24.920
I'll come back to this later go back into terminal to quit the local server and go back to the regular

06:24.920 --> 06:31.920
terminal command screen press control see Django is now all setup will continue working on this project

06:31.920 --> 06:32.790
and the next to Toria.
